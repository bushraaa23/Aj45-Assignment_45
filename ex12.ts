//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, 
//but instead of just printing each personâ€™s name, print a message to them.
 //The text of each message should be the same,
 //but each message should be personalized with the persoon

 //for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
    //console.log(`hello, ${names[i]}! how are you today?`);


// for each
//names.forEach(friend => {
    //console.log(`hi ${friend}! how are you today?`);
//});
// for of loop
//for (let friendName of names) {
   // console.log(`Dear, ${friendName}! how are you today?`);
//}
